            <li class="child-desc-b">Authorized users can lock themselves out of a device if the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reached. In addition, a malicious user can create a denial of service (DoS) condition with repeated attempts to authenticate with a valid username.</li>

            </li>
            <li class="child-desc-b">3. Scan systems for malware

            <li class="child-desc-b">Key points to remember:</li>
            <li class="child-desc-b">Scan using offline software
                Run a second scan using a different program
                No program should run if scanning is not completed. </li>
